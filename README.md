# MarkDownHelper

ETHAN DENYER
V.1.03 
Program which provides support with writing Markdown (.md) files 

If a section isn't needed then we can simply put a capital "X" to skip to the next stage 



# Best Practice Principles Followed:

- Space is included between hashtag and first character in heading.

Requirements for Program Input:

- Where a question requires a number input, it should be written numerically rather than in a text format. E.g. "5" not "five"
- Unless stated otherwise numerical inputs need to be positive integers. 


# Future Improvements & Feedback:
- Repeating inputs when the user has entered the wrong input rather than moving on.
